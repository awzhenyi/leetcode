# Linked List

Most linked list questions can be solved optimally in O(1) space through the use of pointers manipulation as oppossed to the "easy" brute force way in O(n) space that involves creating new ListNodes.

Usage of dummy pointers that point to head (dummy.next = head) so that head pointer can move through the linked list but original order can be preserved by calling dummy.next
